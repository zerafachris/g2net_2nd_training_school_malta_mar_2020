    "We can summarize this curve in a single number: the area under the curve. If our model were perfect, precision and recall would both be 1 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 1. If our model was always wrong, the precision and recall would both be 0 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 0. The better our model is, _regardless of threshold_, the closer the area under the curve is to 1. We eventually need to a choose a threshold and may choose to prioritize precision or recall, but the **area under the precision-recall curve** (AUC), is a very useful metric for assessing model performance in classification tasks."
